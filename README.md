FindersKeepers is a convenient way for students, faculty, and staff to reconnect with their lost items without dumping personal data onto public platforms.
Instead of scrolling through endless snapchat stories, our site is all about simple, direct communication: connecting the person who finds an 
item with the person who owns it.
