<h2>About Campus Lost &amp; Found</h2>

<p>
  Campus Lost &amp; Found is a lightweight, privacy-respecting way for students, faculty,
  and staff to reconnect with lost items without dumping personal data onto public
  platforms. Instead of scrolling through endless photo dumps, our app focuses on a
  simple workflow: from the person who finds an item to the person who can prove they
  own it.
</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Post a find:</strong> Finders create short, anonymous listings without photos or identifying details.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscribe to keywords:</strong> Keepers (people who lost items) follow keywords like “red hoodie,” “ID card,” or “headphones” and get notified when a match appears.</li>
  <li><strong>Prove ownership:</strong> If a listing looks right, the keeper sends a private confirming photo to show they really own the item before any chatting starts.</li>
  <li><strong>Safe relay chat:</strong> Once verified, a temporary relay chat opens so the finder and keeper can arrange a handoff. Messages are filtered for spam/profanity and aren’t stored long-term.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why we built it</h3>
<p>
  Traditional lost and found boards are messy, easy to impersonate, and often exclude
  people who don’t use certain social platforms. Our goal is to build a trustworthy,
  campus-wide tool that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Protects user privacy with anonymous listings and limited data collection.</li>
  <li>Makes impostor claims harder by shifting proof to real owners.</li>
  <li>Stays accessible to the whole campus community, not just one app or social site.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project team &amp; support</h3>
<p>
  This app was developed as a DIDA 425 capstone project with guidance from
  Dr. Jacopo Mazzoni. Our team shares three core values: compromise, ambition, and
  punctuality. We’re committed to maintaining and improving the site so it continues
  to run smoothly for the campus community.
